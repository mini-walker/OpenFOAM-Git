# ðŸ’» My Own OpenFOAM Demo Results

This repository showcases selected **CFD simulation results** generated using **OpenFOAM**. The demos include a variety of fluid dynamics cases I previously computed, and the results are visualized as videos for easier sharing and reference.

All cases were solved using my own OpenFOAM setups and scripts, and serve as **visual summaries** of what OpenFOAM can do in academic or engineering CFD.
